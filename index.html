<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/07/28/latin-america-has-embraced-quotas-for-female-political-candidates">According to The Economist,</a> while the reputation that politics has focuses more on a male persona, female politicians in Latin and South American counties are not uncommon. For example, in 1991, the South American country of Argentina required its parties to nominate women in a certain amount of its races. As of June 2018, 17 of the 18 Spanish or Portuguese-speaking countries in the Americas enact this policy in their political system. Many Hispanic countries removed their dictatorships toward the end of the 1900s; therefore, the rise of female represenation in politics continues to grow. While there are quotas enforced throughout Latin and South American countries, men still maintain a higher proportion of seats in government and support in politics worldwide. However, women aren't stopping anytime soon. The fight for representation in National Parliament and government as a whole is only increasing. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/chart-of-the-day-these-countries-have-the-most-women-in-parliament/">According to the World Economic Forum</a> website, over the last 20 years, there have been many initiatives taken to have more female representation in government and in parliament. Compared to countries in Latin American countries, the United States of America still lags behind in female representation. The U.S. ranks 75th on a list created by the Inter-Parliamentery Union. Because of large discrepancies in political systems based off of gender, Latin American countries introduced quotas to their systems in order to put forward a certain amount of female candidates against men. Many countries have since adopted these policies to reserve seats for women, while some have altered them altogether.</p>
